  "HOMEPAGE_FINDINGS_CONTENT": "<strong>Flows of public money to professional football in Europe are running out of control.</strong> <br /> Stadiums are built and end up costing taxpayers millions more than planned. Cities partake to contracts that hide the true cost of a new stadium. <br />Subsidies are handed out without any oversight. Local politicians can use them to support their crony networks or their own private investments. <br />The spending spree is justified by the added value a professional football club brings to a city. However...<br /><strong> No audit has ever been made</strong> that assesses the added value of subsidies to professional football. The Football Tax is the first ever attempt at understanding how much European taxpayers give to professional football.",
