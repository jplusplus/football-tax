  "HOMEPAGE_FINDINGS_CONTENT": "<strong>Public money flows to professional football in Europe are running out of control.</strong> <br /> Stadiums are being built that end up costing taxpayers millions. Cities engage in contracts that hide the true cost of an operation. <br />Subsidies are handed out without any oversight. Tickets are paid for with taxpayersâ€™ money and handed out by politicians to loyal supporters. <br />The spending spree is justified by the added value a professional football club brings to a city. However...<br /><strong> No audit has ever been made </strong> to estimate such value. Help us to assess and understand these costs.",
