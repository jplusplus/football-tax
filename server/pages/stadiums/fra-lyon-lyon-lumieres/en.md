Unlike other teams, OL decided to build its new stadium alone, with its own cash. Or so it seemed. The city spent €168m on infrastructure so fans can drive to the game. They also provided a lofty €40m guarantee, in case OL cannot pay on its debt. The mayor of the small city of 25,000 that hosts the building, Décines-Charpieux, exonerated OL of taxes but did not care to put the decision to a vote. According to the local Court of Auditors, the gift amounts to €4.2m.
