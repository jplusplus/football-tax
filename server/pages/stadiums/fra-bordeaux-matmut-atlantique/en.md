With Euro2016 coming, the city of Bordeaux asked private companies to build a stadium. Officially, the city paid only 19 million euros. But the devil is in the details! When we add up the commitments the city took for the next 30 years, the cost for the Bordeaux taxpayers is €220m, or €200m more than planned! Faced with such contradictions, the local strongman, Alain Juppé, had a bullet-proof answer. The data is "fanciful", he said. And taxpayers will pay.
