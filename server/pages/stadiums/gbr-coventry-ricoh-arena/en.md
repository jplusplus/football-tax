The Ricoh Arena in Coventry -- which has also hosted some of the events of the London Olympics in 2012, has  been constructed with over 30m GBP of govenment money (including EU funds). The arena complex, which includes a shopping mall, 2 hotels and a casino, has greatly improved the local area, it was reported. In 2011, the city has also extended the trail line and constructed a new station the arena -- which cost 13,6m GBP, and could only transport 75 ppl/h to the stadium. Not too efficient for a 32,000 seat stadium.
