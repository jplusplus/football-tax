Olympique Lyon is not only the former behemoth of French football, it is the only French team run as a corporation and publicly traded. OL is a maze of over 15 companies, with stakes in buildings, a travel agency, a telecom subsidiary and more. Despite these revenue streams, the city subsidizes the club loftily, exempting it of certain taxes and bankrolling its training center.
