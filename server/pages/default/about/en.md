**About**

The Football Tax is a case study for the larger OpenBudgets.eu project. OpenBudgets.eu aims at making local budgets easier to access and understand throughout the European Union. Because football subsidies are a Europe-wide phenomenon and because they involve multiple layers of administration, it provides an excellent testing ground for OpenBudgets.eu's activities.

**Methodology**

The Football Tax centralizes work done by professional journalists, participants in open budget workshops, students and citizens. They all went to great lengths to trace back public spending to professional football. Information comes from media reports and, mostly, from reading through the deliberations of local councils, from the income statements of clubs and from reports from courts of auditors throughout Europe.

Some cases are clear-cut. A city giving a lump-sum subsidy to a club is easy to account for. Other cases are harder to assess. Cities often offer free rents or rents below market prices to football clubs. In such cases, it is almost impossible to put a monetary value on the amount actually given by the city, which should be equal to the difference between what the club pays and what another tenent would pay. We only put a monetary value on such in-kind gifts when the city hall itself decreased the rent of a building. Ancillary items such as train lines or parking lots financed by public actors are taken into account when they exclusively service a stadium.
