The club Standard de Liège, whose net profit amounted to  €19m in 2012 recieved even more in public subsidies (€800m in 2009). The subsidies are justified, according to the mayor, by the participations of the players in communications campaigns of the city, and the availability of places on matches. These justifications are a disservice to the city -- they highlight the fact that there was no public bidding for these tasks -- something that would have been necessary under normal circumstances.
