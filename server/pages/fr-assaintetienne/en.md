Saint-Etienne club was a star of French football until the 80s, when its reputation was tarnished by fraud and corruption -- like the existance of a 'secret fund' that allowed it to keep the best players in the team, or an affair with fake passports. The club was saved by a last-minute agreement involving public money. The club is still receiving plenty of money in public subsidies. It also receives grants for its training facility, and enjoyes a reduced rent to use the stadium.The subsidies represent between 3 and 5% of the revenue of the SASP, but make up 40% of the association's ressources.
