When deciding to construct the new stadium, the mayor has assures the citizens that the cost will amout the 'only' €200m with the PPP. The analysis shows, however, that the assumption does not hold water, as the expenses of the city have went up to €400m. And that is if we don't count the many anomalies that we have seen in the contract of the PPP, like a cartel agreement between the bidders, or the fact that the city of Nice never claimed the fines on the late delivery of the stadium. In short, the city has taken all the risks and expenses, while the private company has taken all the profits and benefits.
